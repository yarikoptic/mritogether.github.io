## Our Pledge

In order to have an open and welcoming scientific environment, we as organisers pledge to make participation in the 
MRI Together workshop a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, and inclusive event.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards other colleauges


Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
The organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. 
Organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant or speaker for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all workshop spaces (live events and the social gathering platform), and it also applies when an individual is representing the workshop in public spaces.


## Enforcement

Please let the organizers know of any potential violations of this Code of Conduct via email to [Nikou Damestani](mailto:NDAMESTANI@mgh.harvard.edu), [mritogether@esmrmb.org](mailto:{{site.email}}), or the [ESMRMB office](mailto:office@esmrmb.org).

The organizers will review potential violations and will determine an appropriate response, up to and including termination of participation in the workshop.
